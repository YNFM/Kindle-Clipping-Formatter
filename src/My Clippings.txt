There are many different genres in the Bible—songs, prophecies, proverbs, laments, visions, speeches, parables, historical narrative. Identifying the genre is very important to how we interpret a passage.

Once you’ve decided on the genre, here are two general principles to follow: When something is presented as historical fact, pause to consider that it really happened. When something is presented as imagery/metaphor, don’t base crazy predictions of the future on its being literally and physically true.

Of course, the fact that something happened doesn’t mean that it can’t have theological or metaphorical significance as well. Miracles, especially, are almost always performed to teach us something; the apostle John prefers to call them “signs” because, like signposts, they point to a truth beyond themselves.

Ninety years later, when I was nine years old in Greenville, the enforced segregation was almost absolute: drinking fountains, public restrooms, public schools, public swimming pools, bus seating, housing, restaurants, hospital waiting rooms, dentist waiting rooms, bus station waiting rooms, and—with their own kind of enforcement—churches, including mine. I can tell you from the inside that, for all the rationalized glosses, it was not “separate but equal.” It was not respectful, it was not just, it was not loving, and therefore it was not Christian. It was ugly and demeaning. And, as we will see, because of my complicity I have much to be sorry about. Which is one reason this book focuses so heavily on the gospel of Jesus Christ. I owe my life and hope to the gospel. Without it I would still be strutting with racist pride, or I would be suffering the moral paralysis of “white guilt.”4 But the gospel has an answer to both pride and guilt.

His mother, Helen, loved the same Christian radio station my mother did—WMUU, the voice of Bob Jones University. But there was a big difference. The very school that broadcast all that Bible truth would not admit blacks. And the large, white Baptist church four miles from Jesse Jackson’s home wouldn’t either. Nor would mine. This was my hometown. And there is no mystery in it as to why a young black man growing up there—or a Martin Luther King growing up in Atlanta a generation earlier—would get his theological education at a liberal institution (such as Chicago Theological Seminary or Crozer Theological Seminary). Our fundamental and evangelical schools—and almost every other institution—especially in the South, were committed to segregation.

I was, in those years, manifestly racist. As a child and a teenager my attitudes and actions assumed the superiority of my race in almost every way without knowing or wanting to know anybody who was black, except Lucy. Lucy came to our house on Saturdays to help my mother clean. I liked Lucy, but the whole structure of the relationship was demeaning. Those who defend the noble spirit of Southern slaveholders by pointing to how nice they were to their slaves, and how deep the affections were, and how they even attended each other’s personal celebrations, seem to be naïve about what makes a relationship degrading. No, she was not a slave. But the point still stands. Of course, we were nice. Of course, we loved Lucy. Of course, she was invited to my sister’s wedding. As long as she and her family “knew their place.” Being nice to, and having strong affections for, and including in our lives is what we do for our dogs too. It doesn’t say much about honor and respect and equality before God. My affections for Lucy did not provide the slightest restraint on my racist mouth when I was with my friends.

In 1962 my home church voted not to allow blacks into the services.6 The rationale, as I remember, was that in the heated context of the civil rights era, the only reason blacks would want to be there would be political, which is not what church is for.

Urbana Missions Conference in December 1967. During a question-and-answer time before thousands of students, we heard Warren Webster, general director of the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society, and former missionary to Pakistan, answer a student’s question: What if your daughter falls in love with a Pakistani while you’re on the mission field and wants to marry him? The question was clearly asked from a standpoint of concern that this would be a racial or ethnic dilemma for Webster. (This was four months before Martin Luther King Jr. was killed.) With great forcefulness, Webster said something like: “Better a Christian Pakistani than a godless white American!”

Jewett’s introduction to that syllabus ends like this: And now let us listen to the groans of Frederick Douglass, feel the lash with Amy, endure the satire of Du Bois, and measure the wrath of Malcolm X; let us contemplate the pathos of black childhood and the tragedy of black womanhood. And let us not forget that [as Martin Luther King Jr. said] “he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” And let us also remember that if God has given us a revelation of the true nature of man, surely we will render account if we do not live in the light of that revelation, and especially so if we are called to the holy office of the Christian ministry.10

In the summer of 1980, I accepted the call to Bethlehem Baptist Church, a 109-year-old center-city church on the edge of downtown Minneapolis. To my mind the location was perfect for the kind of impulses I felt. To the west was the upscale business district. To the north, the Metrodome (just being built) and light industrial district. To the east, the University of Minnesota. And to the south, the poorest and most diverse part of the city—Elliot Park and Phillips neighborhood. We moved into the city and have lived within walking distance of the church in Elliot Park and Phillips ever since (now almost thirty years). The 2005 ethnic breakdown of our neighborhood was 24.6 percent Caucasian, 29 percent African American, 22 percent Hispanic, 11 percent Native American, 5.9 percent Asian, 7.4 percent other.12 Immigration patterns have changed over the years with various groups swelling and shrinking from time to time. But that is pretty much what I see out of my study window on 11th Avenue South. ADOPTION AT FIFTY This is where I wanted to be. And this is where I would like to die. God could move me. But it will take a crystal-clear divine call to make me leave this kind of diversity. Noël and I raised four sons in this neighborhood. We used to joke that the reason we don’t have a television is that the boys can watch the nightly news on the streets outside their house.

I am not writing this book as a successful multiethnic leader. I am not successful. I am not an expert in diversity. If you came looking for the pragmatic silver bullet for the multiethnic congregation, I may as well bid you farewell. I don’t have it. I write because of truth I see in the Scriptures, convictions I have in my mind, and longings I feel in my heart. I believe that the gospel—the good news of Christ crucified in our place to remove the wrath of God and provide forgiveness of sins and power for sanctification—is our only hope for the kind of racial diversity and harmony that ultimately matters. If we abandon the fullness of the gospel to make racial and ethnic diversity quicker or easier, we create a mere shadow of the kingdom, an imitation. And we lose the one thing that can bring about Christ-exalting diversity and harmony. Any other kind is an alluring snare. For what does it profit a man if he gains complete diversity and loses his own soul?

Second, I have a debt to pay. I have already confessed in chapter 1 the racism of my youth. As much as I tore down, I would like to build up. This is not penance—as though I did not believe the blood of Christ were sufficient to cover all my sins. This book does not atone for anything. Christ is our only atonement. And he is enough. That is not the kind of debt I have to pay. If I slander a colleague and later I repent, I owe him the effort to restore his good name. If I break out your window in a drunken stupor, I owe you a new window and will work on it when I am sober. If I demean a racial group, I owe them the effort to affirm their dignity when I awake from my stupor. But there is more to it than that. The debt I feel is not mainly to any particular group. This is a debt to all sinners. It is the kind of happy debt awakened by the experience of God’s grace in Christ. Paul said in Romans 1:14, “I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians;1 both to the wise, and to the unwise” (KJV). What did he mean by that? He meant that, owing to nothing in himself, Jesus had called him and forgiven him and accepted him and promised him everlasting joy in the presence of God. As he looked around at the “Barbarians” and “Greeks,” he saw people who were just as undeserving of grace as he was. Neither he nor they had any right to the grace of God. But here he was—the “foremost” of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15)—overwhelmed with Jesus’s redeeming love. The effect this had on Paul was to give him a joyful sense of indebtedness to all other sinners like himself. The debt was not to complete Jesus’s payment for sin; it was the overflow of the fullness of that payment. “I owe you the gospel” did not mean “You deserve it.” It meant, “I did not deserve it either, and by its very nature it cannot be hoarded. I must tell you the gospel or I will deny the grace reigning in me.” That is the way I feel about God’s rescuing me from the sins of my youth, especially the sins rooted in racism.

Some churches have never taken the first baby steps in thinking biblically about race and ethnicity. Others devote so much focus to it that people get sick of the issue, and backlash sets in. Neither of these extremes is helpful. The aim is biblical maturity—thoughtful, balanced, careful, informed, humble, experienced, wise, Jesus-exalting, God-centered, gospel-strengthened growth in the way we think and talk and act in regard to race and ethnicity—and in relation to real people different from ourselves.

The world has experienced unprecedented urban growth in recent decades. In 2000, about 47 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas, about 2.8 billion. There are 411 cities over 1 million. More developed nations are about 76 percent urban, while 40 percent of residents of less developed countries live in urban areas. However, urbanization is occurring rapidly in many less developed countries. It is expected that 60 percent of the world population will be urban by 2030.4 With this urbanization comes increasing ethnic diversity. And that means people who are ethnically different are thrown closer together. The urgency of racial and ethnic harmony amid increasing diversity increases year by year.

the Christian church is undergoing dramatic demographic shifts that will increasingly marginalize people who are not eager to be a part of something more diverse and less white. Philip Jenkins, professor of history and religious studies at Pennsylvania State University, has clarified this development perhaps more than any one.7 The new terminology that has been introduced into our vocabulary is the term Global South, a reference to the astonishing growth of the Christian church in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, while the formerly dominant centers of Christian influence in Europe are weakening.

The point of these statistics about the urbanization, diversification, and the changing global church is fourfold. First, I hope they humble those of us who are white and have assumed a kind of dominance for a long time. This is fading, and, if God would humble us under his wise and mighty hand, we would rejoice with tremendous joy. Second, I hope this new ethnic reality inclines our hearts to know and love our Christian brothers and sisters who are ethnically different from ourselves and makes us eager and ready to be genuine partners with them in the great challenges of missions before us.

An OBJECTIVE , I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution. KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. ( As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number.”) You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t; there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the designated period, typically a quarter, we declare the key result fulfilled or not. Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if it isn’t, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.) My

Superpower #1—Focus and Commit to Priorities (chapters 4, 5, and 6): High-performance organizations home in on work that’s important, and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter. OKRs impel leaders to make hard choices. They’re a precision communication tool for departments, teams, and individual contributors. By dispelling confusion, OKRs give us the focus needed to win. Superpower #2—Align and Connect for Teamwork (chapters 7, 8, and 9): With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals—from the CEO down—are openly shared. Individuals link their objectives to the company’s game plan, identify cross-dependencies, and coordinate with other teams. By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation. Superpower #3—Track for Accountability (chapters 10 and 11): OKRs are driven by data. They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment—all in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. An endangered key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted. Superpower #4—Stretch for Amazing (chapters 12, 13, and 14): OKRs motivate us to excel by doing more than we’d thought possible. By testing our limits and affording the freedom to fail, they release our most creative, ambitious selves.

I will introduce OKRs’ younger sibling, CFRs (C onversation, F eedback, R ecognition), and show how OKRs and CFRs can team up to lift leaders, contributors, and organizations to a whole new level. Continuous Improvement (chapter 17): As a case study for structured goal setting and continuous performance management, we see a robotics-powered pizza company deploys OKRs in every aspect of its operations, from the kitchen to marketing and sales. The Importance of Culture (chapters 18, 19, and 20): Here we’ll explore the impact of OKRs on the workplace, and how they ease and expedite culture change.

“Expertise was very much valued there,” Andy explained. “That is why people got hired. That’s why people got promoted. Their effectiveness at translating that knowledge into actual results was kind of shrugged off.” At Intel, he went on, “we tend to be exactly the opposite. It almost doesn’t matter what you know. It’s what you can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish [that] tends to be valued here.” Hence the company’s slogan: “Intel delivers.” It almost doesn’t matter what you know. . . . To claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all-important—well, I wouldn’t learn that at Harvard. I found the proposition thrilling, a real-world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials.

A few unvarnished excerpts, straight from the father of OKRs: * Now, the two key phrases . . . are objectives and the key result. And they match the two purposes. The objective is the direction: “We want to dominate the mid-range microcomputer component business.” That’s an objective. That’s where we’re going to go. Key results for this quarter: “Win ten new designs for the 8085” is one key result. It’s a milestone. The two are not the same. . . . The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it. Now, did we dominate the mid-range microcomputer business? That’s for us to argue in the years to come, but over the next quarter we’ll know whether we’ve won ten new designs or not.

a basic truth of human nature: When people help choose a course of action, they are more likely to see it through. In 1954, in his landmark book The Practice of Management , Drucker codified this principle as “management by objectives and self-control.” It became Andy Grove’s foundation and the genesis of what we now call the OKR.

He sought to “create an environment that values and emphasizes output” and to avoid what Drucker termed the “activity trap”: “[S]tressing output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.” On an assembly line, it’s easy enough to distinguish output from activity. It gets trickier when employees are paid to think. Grove wrestled with two riddles: How can we define and measure output by knowledge workers? And what can be done to increase it?

The essence of a healthy OKR culture—ruthless intellectual honesty, a disregard for self-interest, deep allegiance to the team—flowed from the fiber of Andy Grove’s being. But it was Grove’s nuts-and-bolts approach, his engineer’s mentality, that made the system work.

Less is more. “A few extremely well-chosen objectives,” Grove wrote, “impart a clear message about what we say ‘yes’ to and what we say ‘no’ to.” A limit of three to five OKRs per cycle leads companies, teams, and individuals to choose what matters most. In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results.

Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. When all goals are set top-down, motivation is corroded.

No dictating. OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities and define how progress will be measured. Even after company objectives are closed to debate, their key results continue to be negotiated. Collective agreement is essential to maximum goal achievement.

Dare to fail. “Output will tend to be greater,” Grove wrote, “when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond [their] immediate grasp. . . . Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates.” While certain operational objectives must be met in full, aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and possibly unattainable.

A tool, not a weapon. The OKR system, Grove wrote, “is meant to pace a person—to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review.” To encourage risk taking and prevent sandbagging, OKRs and bonuses are best kept separate.

Be patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error. As Grove told his iOPEC students, Intel “stumbled a lot of times” after adopting OKRs: “We didn’t fully understand the principal purpose of it. And we are kind of doing better with it as time goes on.” An organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully embrace the system, and even more than that to build mature goal muscle.

Early on, just after the first of the year, Bob Noyce and Andy Grove staged a Crush kickoff at the San Jose Hyatt House. Their directive to Intel’s management corps was simple and clear: “We’re going to win in 16-bit microprocessors.

And it couldn’t have happened without the key result system. If Andy had run the San Jose meeting without it, how could he have simultaneously kicked off all those Crush activities? I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen people walk out of meetings saying, “I’m going to conquer the world” . . . and three months later, nothing has happened. You get people whipped up with enthusiasm, but they don’t know what to do with it. In a crisis, you need a system that can drive transformation—quickly. That’s what the key result system did for Intel. It gave management a tool for rapid implementation. And when people reported on what they’d gotten done, we had black-and-white criteria for assessment.

Crush was a thoroughly cascaded set of OKRs, heavily driven from the top, but with input from below. At Andy Grove’s level, or even my level, you couldn’t know all the mechanics of how the battle should be won. A lot of this stuff has to flow uphill. You can tell people to clean up a mess, but should you be telling them which broom to use? When top management was saying “We’ve got to crush Motorola!” somebody at the bottom might have said “Our benchmarks are lousy; I think I’ll write some better benchmarks.”

A field engineer tells his general manager, “You turkeys don’t understand what’s happening in the market,” and within two weeks, the whole company is realigned, top to bottom. Everyone’s agreed: “The whistleblower is right. We’ve got to act differently.” It was terribly important that Don Buckout and Casey Powell felt they could speak their minds without retribution.

We should learn from that previous generation the vital lesson of perseverance. We must keep trusting and obeying God’s promise to us in Jesus right up until the day we enter God’s rest. As an aside, we don’t think that this means that Christians can “lose” their salvation. The rest of the Bible is pretty clear about that (e.g. Phil. 1:6; John 10:28–29). But that doesn’t mean that we are free to ignore the warnings, either. It’s a bit like having a “Danger, Steep Drop” sign on the edge of a cliff. The presence of the sign doesn’t mean that lots of people fall off; in fact, the sign is the means by which they don’t. It would be stupid, though, to play around the edge.

The heartbreaking reality is that since the decisive legal breakthroughs of the civil rights movement, things have deteriorated for a huge segment of the black population in America. Bill Cosby has been praised and pilloried for his public lament over this situation. Juan Williams built an entire book around Cosby’s famous—or infamous, depending on your point of view—speech on May 17, 2004, in Washington, DC, at Constitution Hall. Three thousand people were gathered to celebrate the golden anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), in which the Supreme Court ordered the integration of public schools. The title of Juan Williams’s book sums up Cosby’s message: Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America—and What We Can Do About It.6 What we hear from Cosby and Williams is a cry, almost of desperation, that the world would take notice of the developments that Williams calls “a mortal threat to the race.”

There is certainly institutional racism—particularly against black men—but racism doesn’t explain everything. . . . The stereotype of the angry and potentially violent black male can lead to racial profiling by teachers in the early grades. This makes it doubly difficult for those boys who are trying to behave and trying to get ahead to succeed. Soon the kids begin to stereotype themselves. These images lead to low expectations for achievement, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And what is that stereotype that white money-moguls exploit for millions of dollars, as rap surpassed country music in 2001 and became America’s most popular music genre?17 What is the stereotype in gangster rap that is purchased not mainly by black men, black women, and white women, but by “white men, mostly high-school- and college-age boys”? What is this stereotype that invites “immature white males to indulge their basest feelings about women and blacks”?18 What is this white-funded, debasing stereotype of the black male? The rappers reinforce in the minds of those wild white frat boys—later to become our corporate captains and managers—that black women are sexually indiscriminate, stupid, greedy, and lazy. Young black men are thugs, and, in the words of music critic Stanley Crouch, “monkey-moving, gold-chain-wearing, illiteracy-spouting, penis-pulling, sullen, combative buffoons.”

How do white-run music companies get away with this?21 It happens through a stunning perversion of black pride. Common sense was dismissed by rappers and their corporate partners as feeble protests from stuck-up white people and bourgeois black people who had lost touch with their ghetto roots. The defense of gangster rap, with its pride in guns and murder, was that it was all about “keepin’ it real.” In that stunning perversion of black culture, anyone who spoke against the self-destructive core of gangster rap was put down as acting white or selling out the ghetto. Violence, murder, and self-hatred were marketed as true blackness—authentic black identity.22 In this way Williams interweaves the white guilt of racial exploitation for big money with the black guilt of complicity in the perversion of the black experience that Martin Luther King Jr. died to make possible.

In the heartbreaking story of white and black sinfulness since the civil rights movement, there is a downward spiral together. It is not as though the white culture stood fast during these decades on some 1950s moral high ground. The white children of the flower children of the sixties have paid dearly for the abandonment of truth and moral absolutes. Many studies have documented the collapse of moral clarity and virtue in the white church and mainstream white culture.

And together with every other race, whites are killing their babies and wallowing in their porn and taking their illegal drugs and leaving their wives and having babies without marriage. The difference is that when you develop patterns of sin in the majority race, they have no racial connotation. Since majority people don’t think of themselves in terms of race, none of our dysfunctions is viewed as a racial dysfunction. When you are the majority ethnicity, nothing you do is ethnic. It’s just the way it’s done. When you are a minority, everything you do has color.

The majority culture (which for a little while longer is still white) has the luxury of being oblivious to race (which would change in an instant, if we moved to Nigeria). But for minority peoples, race-related issues are a persistent part of consciousness. If these issues are silently ignored in our relationships, the resulting harmony will be shallow and fragile.

The term personal responsibility sums up one cluster of strategies. The term structural features sums up the other. The question is, Is the main problem today “structural (or systemic) racism” or is the main problem “personal responsibility”?11 We should not be pressed to an either-or mentality here.

They give a good example of the difference between the merely personal and the structural approach toward racial change: Recall that in the Jim Crow era, “Most evangelicals, even in the North, did not think it their duty to oppose segregation; it was enough to treat blacks they knew personally with courtesy and fairness.” The racialized system itself is not directly challenged. What is challenged is the treatment of individuals within the system.

Emerson and Smith, like Dyson, are right to point out the importance of structural obstacles that stand in the way of the fullest experience of freedom and virtue and productivity. But they seem to assume that if evangelicals would “see” and “challenge” the structures of our racialized society, the strategies would be obvious and the effect would be positive.

Here is where the other viewpoint comes in. For many black thinkers, it is not at all obvious that this heavy focus on challenging the structures of institutional racism is where the emphasis should fall today. And even where it is still needed, the way to tackle the problem structurally is not transparent.

This horror show—a refusal to master standard English, lack of interest in formal schooling, the acceptance of a culture of failure—is passed on to children and grandchildren as a legacy of being authentically black, when really it is a legacy of failure. And the tide of failure keeps rising, drowning soul after soul. The tragedy is blamed on white people, racism, or even abandonment by the black middle class. Yet there is no leadership speaking out to black parents and black students about the destructive cycle rooted in a crippling culture that sells disregard for education.

As true as it is that such deadly cycles are rooted in centuries of slavery and white discrimination, the point of Williams and Cosby and the others is that damning whites doesn’t save blacks. When the house is on fire, you holler for the kids to run, no matter who set the fire. Williams and the other writers who are sounding these alarms do not let whites off the hook from the obligation to work for better access for all to quality education. Shelby Steele puts it in a balanced way so that we who are white are sure to get our half of the message: “Blacks can have no real power without taking responsibility for their own educational and economic development. Whites can have no racial innocence without earning it by eradicating discrimination and helping the disadvantaged to develop.”

The gospel of Jesus does not come to the controversy between personal accountability and structural intervention and take sides. It calls both sides to repent and believe in Jesus and be born again and make the glory of Jesus the supreme issue in life. The gospel is not a political adviser standing to the side waiting to be asked for guidance. It is the arrival of God saving people from their sin and from the everlasting wrath of God, giving them the Holy Spirit, and bringing their lives progressively into conformity to Jesus. For this reason, the impact of the gospel in race relations is unpredictable. It has potentials that no one can conceive.

Guilt is a huge player in the way blacks and whites relate to each other. It’s huge and deadly when it is denied. It’s huge and deadly when it is wallowed in. It’s huge and deadly when it is exploited. There is no deliverance and no relief and no healing in any of those ways of dealing with guilt. Denial drives it below the surface where it creates endless illusions and self-justifications. Wallowing in it produces phony humility and obsequiousness and moral cowardice. Exploiting it gives a false sense of power that turns out to be only the weapon of weakness.

Pride loves to be made much of by men. It craves human approval. It may try to look cool in order to intimidate others. Or it may be meek and retiring for fear of offending others. It can look strong, and it can look weak. In either case, it is consumed with self and what a select group of others think. Racial tensions are rife with pride—the pride of white supremacy, the pride of black power, the pride of intellectual analysis, the pride of anti-intellectual scorn, the pride of loud verbal attack, and the pride of despising silence, the pride that feels secure, and the pride that masks fear. Where pride holds sway, there is no hope for the kind of listening and patience and understanding and openness to correction that relationships require. The gospel of Jesus breaks the power of pride by revealing the magnitude and the ugliness and the deadliness of it, even as it provides deliverance from it. The gospel makes plain that I am so hopelessly sinful and my debt before God was so huge that my salvation required the death of the Son of God in my place. This is devastating to the human ego. And God means it to be: “By grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8–9).

When there is no hope beyond the grave, it is extremely difficult to talk yourself into the kind of self-denial required by justice movements such as civil rights. The energy it takes and the sacrifices one must make may seem heroic and admirable for a while, but the meaninglessness of it all will overtake you if you really feel hopeless about the moment of death. It seems to me that we can call for personal responsibility till we are blue in the face, and the appeals will have no power at all without the awakening of hope.

Since all humans have a sinful craving to be seen as worthy or admirable in some way, we all fear being seen as inferior or unworthy or foolish. These fears are manifested, or masked, in very different ways ranging from the most pathological paralysis of depression, to self-hatred and self-destructive behaviors, to profound anxiety in the face of public opportunities, to sullen withdrawal from the world, to whining and complaining at how others make life difficult, to repeated pity parties in which we maneuver to get others to feel sorry for us, to constant putdowns of others so that our own flaws are minimized, to a cocky cloaking of our limitations that intimidates others with one kind of power to conceal another kind of weakness. These sorrows and sins are not unique to any ethnic group. They are universal. But the history of a group shapes the way the fear is felt. Shelby Steele gives painful and penetrating expression to the effects of black history and black stereotypes on the black psyche. The condition of being black in America means that one will likely endure more wounds to one’s self-esteem than others and that the capacity for self-doubt born of these wounds will be compounded and expanded by the black race’s reputation of inferiority. . . . Black skin has more dehumanizing stereotypes associated with it than any other skin color in America, if not the world. When a black person presents himself in an integrated situation, he knows that his skin alone may bring these stereotypes to life in the mind of those he meets and that he, as an individual, may be diminished by his race before he has a chance to reveal a single aspect of his personality. . . . He will be vulnerable to the entire realm of his self-doubt before a single word is spoken. . . . Certainly in every self-avowed white racist, whether businessman or member of the Klan, there is a huge realm of self-contempt and doubt that hides behind the mythology of white skin. The mere need to pursue self-esteem through skin color suggests there is no faith that it can be pursued any other way. But if skin color offers whites a certain false esteem and impunity, it offers blacks vulnerability. This vulnerability begins for blacks with the recognition that we belong, quite simply, to the most despised race in the human community of races. To be a member of such a group in a society where all others gain an impunity by merely standing in relation to us is to live with a relentless openness to diminishment and shame.2

It is heartbreaking to see people of goodwill trying to patch up the damaged self-esteem of children in the hope that they will find it within them to be motivated for great achievements. It is a fool’s errand. Even the shrewd analysis of Shelby Steele falls short of any real solution: Educational reform for black students . . . [focuses] generally on identity enhancement and self-esteem. Its profound mistake is to assume that performance follows self-esteem, when in fact it is the other way around: performance follows high expectations; not high self-esteem. The proof of this is that Asian-American students routinely test lower on self-esteem measures than blacks, who routinely test higher than any other student group.3 But how do you break into this vicious cycle of self-doubt when all of us are sinners? We are torn—all of us—between the self-exalting pride of our hearts and our fearful, self-doubting sense of inferiority. What is the use of trying to build self-esteem for sinners without the gospel? It will only mask true weaknesses and sins while it feeds the inborn arrogance that we all have. Only the gospel can do two seemingly contradictory things: destroy pride and increase courage. Destroy self-exaltation and increase confidence. Destroy the pushiness of self-assertion and deliver from the paralysis of self-doubt.

Race relations in America were plunged into ruin and destruction the day the first slave arrived in America, kidnapped for white gain against God’s law (Ex. 21:16; Deut. 24:7). And greed has driven the ruin and destruction of race relations ever since. And the greed in black hearts is no different from the greed in white hearts. Our shared sinfulness simply expresses itself in different ways according to our circumstances. There is only one way to be free from greed for the glory of God—faith in the gospel of Christ. First, the gospel transfers our security from the power of money to the promises of God. When we trust Christ, our fear of the future is replaced by confidence in God.

What God is telling us is that forgiveness and love do not mean the perpetrators get away with their abuses and injustices. They don’t. If they come to faith in Christ, their sins will be covered by his blood. But if they do not come to Christ, their sins will come on their own head, and God will see that justice is done. In this way, a life of love and forgiveness—a life of treating bad people better than they deserve—is not a foolish life. God’s mercy and vengeance frees us from the soul-destroying bitterness of hatred and anger and blaming and vengeance. It makes us merciful without making us naïve about evil. This effect of the gospel of Christ would transform the world of race and ethnicity more than we can imagine. Who can begin to describe the possibilities of reconciliation and harmony where the work of Christ replaces hatred with love, anger with patience, and blaming with forgiving, and all of this without surrendering a passion that justice must be done?

Money! What has worth, out here in the Long Earth? What has value when every man can own his own goldmine? Interesting theoretical question when you think about it, isn’t it? Among ourselves we do use Datum currencies. Since the Long Earth recession cut in, the yen and the US dollar have held up, especially since they are unforgeable. The British pound collapsed earlier, when half the population fled from that crowded little island – including Franklin, our invaluable smith. Nevertheless, Britain, not for the first time, showed the way out of adversity. In their bad economic years the Brits evolved the ‘favour’, a currency of flexible worth. In short, it was a unit notional coin whose value was agreed by the buyer and seller at the point of transaction – which made it rather difficult to tax, and so it worked very badly back on the Datum. But it’s the ideal currency in the new worlds, which is not surprising since the system was once used in the embryo United States of America, when there was no coin to be had and no effective government to validate its use even if there were. In places like Reboot, you see, your life is full of small trades. You boil animal fats and make tallow, and since you made too much, maybe your neighbour could use some, and indeed she could, and offers a pound of iron ore in return. That isn’t very useful to you, but it certainly is to Franklin the smith, and you hand it over to him in exchange for favour, to be repaid at some future time. So you are now owed a favour, which might be something solid, or even an offer to bring back store-bought goods next time he has to go to Hundred K or the Datum. Or whatever. It’s no system to run a civilization on, but a pretty good one for a colony of a hundred people every single one of whom you know personally, and they know you. No point in cheating; that will only work for a little while. After all you don’t want to be the person who has the doors shut on you when you most desperately need help.

2. Implementation costs One of the most important aspects of each business project is its implementation price. It defines the basic budget parameters and to a great extend the future of the project, as well as its implementation or cancelation, because the price is a definitive factor for any investment. Because the integration projects are basically software projects, and their implementation requires highly qualified software engineers, we can mention that their implementation price may be evaluated based on person-hours that are needed for development and on the effort for implementation which is the main factor influencing on the amount of needed person-hours

3. Total cost of ownership/operations Besides the cost of implementation, each information system, including integration environments, requires costs for operation, maintenance and possible expansion. These costs must be added to the cost of implementation to estimate so called TCO (Total Cost of Ownership - TCO). In terms of project management and business, this is one of the most important indicators, as it measures total cost of the investment in an integration project and allows this value to be compared with the potential benefits. The total cost of ownership includes the total amount of cost of implementation plus operational costs, maintenance costs and expansion costs

Service level indicators values are standardized documents, which indicate concrete indicators of the service level provided by the service provider (Rouse, 2015). Such indicators usually are the estimated time of withdrawal operability (downtime), the mean time to restore operability (mean time to recovery - MTTR),the responsibility for reporting on service failures, the capacity and the throughput of communication channels, performance, the measurable response and serve request times, the percentage of rejected applications (abandonment rate), the scheduled interval for preliminary warning about a change in the work of the service or infrastructure (schedule for notification in advance), the response time of the help and support desk on various classes of problems (help desk response time) and others.

The Rise & Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism & the Road to Sexual Revolution (Carl R. Trueman)
- Your Highlight at location 244-257 | Added on Sunday, 16 May 2021 19:09:57

The sexual revolution does not simply represent a growth in the routine transgression of traditional sexual codes or even a modest expansion of the boundaries of what is and is not acceptable sexual behavior; rather, it involves the abolition of such codes in their entirety. More than that, it has come in certain areas, such as that of homosexuality, to require the positive repudiation of traditional sexual mores to the point where belief in, or maintenance of, such traditional views has come to be seen as ridiculous and even a sign of serious mental or moral deficiency. The most obvious evidence of this change is the way language has been transformed to serve the purpose of rendering illegitimate any dissent from the current political consensus on sexuality. Criticism of homosexuality is now homophobia; that of transgenderism is transphobia. The use of the term phobia is deliberate and effectively places such criticism of the new sexual culture into the realm of the irrational and points toward an underlying bigotry on the part of those who hold such views. As I highlight in chapter 9, this kind of thinking underlies even decisions in the Supreme Court. It is also evident in the artifacts of popular culture: no one today needs to be told that a movie with the title The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a comedy. The very idea of someone reaching the age of forty with no experience of sexual intercourse is inherently comic because of the value society now places on sex. To be sexually inactive is to be a less-than-whole person, to be obviously unfulfilled or weird. The old sexual codes of celibacy outside marriage and chastity within it are considered ridiculous and oppressive, and their advocates wicked or stupid or both. The sexual revolution is truly a revolution in that it has turned the moral world upside down.

Step 1: Know the History of the Problem I begin in this article with some brief historical reflections. I am indebted to some recent books on race and slavery that have taught me a good deal. Among the best researched of these are some works by Thomas Sowell.[1] He points out that until the nineteenth century, slavery in one form or another had been part of every major civilization. Various Chinese dynasties had slaves; Indians had slaves; the dominant African tribes had slaves (substantial numbers of slaves sold to the Western world and to the Persian Gulf were sold by other Africans); the Israelites had slaves; the Egyptians, Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans all had slaves. The major “barbarian” tribes of Europe had slaves. The Arab world had slaves. So there is a sense in which, from the vantage of history until about two centuries ago, the phenomenon of slavery was not itself viewed as shocking.

It is estimated that about eleven million Africans were shipped to the Americas (though substantial numbers failed to reach the other side, owing to the horrific conditions slaves had to endure in the boats). At the same time, about fourteen million Africans were shipped up the Persian Gulf or across the Sahara into the Arab and Egyptian worlds under traveling conditions more horrific yet.[

These realities meant that slavery in the Roman Empire was a bit different from that in the West. In the West, none of the slavery was the result of free people selling themselves into slavery because they were bankrupt. More important, in the Roman world there were slaves from many different races and cultures: slaves could be British, from the Italian peninsula, Jewish, African, and so on. But there were also free individuals from all those heritages, and some of these were learned or influential. That meant that there was little identification between slavery and one particular race.[4] By contrast, in the West from the beginning almost all blacks were slaves, and certainly only blacks were slaves.[5] That meant that even after legal emancipation, the psychological association of slavery and black skin has lingered on for a long time both in the minds of whites and in the minds of blacks.

integrating Christian churches. For without giving it much thought, when we think of integrated churches, we primarily think of black/white integration, and we usually assume the deepest barriers are on the white side, the majority side. But the issues are complicated. Without for a moment wanting to play down the commonness of white prejudice, we must reflect as well on the many Korean churches here, the many Chinese churches, the many Latino and Vietnamese churches, and so forth. In all of these cases, very often the Christians who are least desirous of integrating with others are from the minority side: many Koreans and Chinese and Vietnamese and Latinos want to preserve something of their own culture and race and heritage. Some of the problems come, as we shall see, in the second and third generation. And similarly, it is not too surprising that many African-Americans would prefer to worship in African-American churches, even while they may feel that the point of exclusion is entirely or almost entirely on the European-American side.

Second, there has been a shift from the agenda of the 1960s to the agenda of the 1990s and beyond. In the 1960s the call was for equality, inclusion, integration; in the 1990s and now in the new millennium, the call is for multiculturalism, respect for diversity, the importance of preserving distinct communities.[6] Inevitably, therefore, “otherness” is more difficult to assess. It might be a reflection of the desire to preserve something good, not least among minorities themselves; equally, it might be a reflection of xenophobia, resentment, exclusion. The human heart being what it is, in most cases both of these motives will surface simultaneously.

I think we need more public discussion of the fact that racism usually comes from both sides of any race divide. Many African-Americans do not accept this. They think that racism is the sin of the powerful, the sin of the overlord; they think of racism as the sum of racial prejudice plus power. By definition, then, they cannot be racists since they do not have the power. I do not see how thoughtful Christians, black or white, can accept such a definition. True, slavery is the sin of the powerful, not the weak; and very often racism follows the same pattern. But if racism is defined in terms of exclusion, then racism occurs wherever anyone is dismissed or disowned or demeaned or stereotyped for no other reason than his or her race or ethnicity.

It may be useful to draw an analogy. If materialism is the exclusive sin of the rich, then only rich people can be materialistic. But if materialism is the passionate love of material goods, such that God himself is deposed, then poor people may be as horribly materialistic as the rich.

As far as I could tell, this church was very much a reflection of the demographics of the borough. Does this mean that these two churches are more spiritual than their more monolithic counterparts in the Midwest? I doubt it. I was overjoyed to visit them. But both churches reflected the demographics of their respective areas, and in those parts of the country there is a lot more “mixing” already going on in the culture. Some of this, doubtless, is a very good thing: it can ease tensions, add rich diversity to a church, and prove to be a witness to others. On the other hand, one suspects that some of the mixing is achieved in the culture at large, as well as in the local church, by the “flattening” of cultural or racial distinctives.

The enrichment of the common pool is sometimes at the expense of preserving the distinctiveness of the separate inherited cultures. However much we may admire the peace, we would be less than candid if we did not admit that something is being lost by this bargain. In other words, thoughtful Christians will surely hesitate before they adopt without reservation some Christianized version of the “melting pot” model. There is something lost in each of the contributing subcultures, as well as something gained in the new mix, by the “flattening” that has made the mix more socially acceptable. Moreover, precisely because these changes are demonstrably taking place in the broader culture, it is less than transparent that the churches are at the front end of such change. In some cases, at least, they are simply going along with the trajectory of the broader culture.

In similar fashion, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, and other congregations were started. Is this zeal somehow a betrayal of the New Testament goal to build one church? Before deciding, one must remember that there are other New Testament goals—goals which, like the passion for unity, are motivated by love. In particular, consider the passion for evangelism, the concern to win people from every tribe and people and nation. Very frequently this is most effectively and strategically done in the language and culture of the targeted group. In this particular church, the elders/leaders of the diverse congregations work together, strategize together, and pray together as a team.

Clearly there is a tension here—a tension between building one church that displays Christian love, and the Christian love that reaches out to people in all their diversity. That tension is already found in the pages of the New Testament. The same apostle Paul who refused in Jerusalem to permit Titus to be circumcised because he thought that the heart of the gospel was at stake (Gal. 2:1-5), and who was passionately committed to the unity of the church (e.g., Eph. 4:1-3), was quite prepared to circumcise Timothy because he wanted to knock down any obstruction to the promulgation of the gospel in Jewish circles (Acts 16:3).[8] To a cynical outsider, this might look like cheap compromise, raw pragmatism, or an unprincipled desire to please different people (see the charge leveled against Paul in Galatians 1:10). In fact, competing principles are at stake, competing goals, both rightly driven ideally by Christian love. But it is Christian love in service of the Christian gospel, well understood and articulated.

The point is that globalization, like many a cultural development, can have both good and bad effects. It can breed a sad “flattening” of rich cultural diversity. That flattening in turn can breed a number of defensive postures in which everything in “my” culture assumes an unwarranted importance, and globalization is nothing but a threat. But a global perspective can also expose us to different points of view, to different ways of tackling things, to different models. Provided these are set within the nonnegotiables of the gospel, they can only enrich us, teach us humility, expand our horizons, and help us to worship all the more knowledgeably and fervently the God who so loves diversity that he promises to gather men and women from every tongue and tribe and people and nation.

I doubt that we shall improve much in Christian circles until the parties with the most power reflect a lot more than in the past on matters of justice, and the parties most victimized reflect a lot more than in the past on forgiveness.[10] Perhaps the former need to get down on their knees and read Amos; the latter need to get down on their knees and read 1 Peter. All of us need to return to the cross. For the cross teaches us that if all we ask for is justice, we are all damned; it teaches us that God himself is passionately interested in forgiveness and its price.

First, we must not pit justice against forgiveness but humbly attend both demands. A few years ago one of my colleagues was lecturing at an evening class made up entirely of African-American students. All of them held down jobs during the day; in the evening they were trying to get some Bible and theology to enable them better to serve their local churches. My colleague was lecturing on the night that the TV networks first showed the beating of Rodney King by the L.A. police. The students were seething with rage. My colleague encouraged them to talk about their own experiences of suffering racism. All of them had bitter stories to tell. This cauldron of barely suppressed anger simmered for almost an hour. Then my colleague asked the question, “What theological principles should we be thinking about as we face up to racism?” Everyone in the class almost exploded with the answer: “Justice! Justice!” My colleague then asked, “And what biblical passages do you have in mind?” No one could mention a single one. Certainly no one mentioned forgiveness, and no one mentioned the cross. On the other hand, many a white church in a mixed-race community is full of people who honestly think they are above racism and yet who have never once fully tried to understand what it would be like for a black family to come into their church. “Of course they’re welcome,” these fine folk might protest. “Anyone is welcome here.” But all it takes is for one member to say something really insensitive, and all of the courage it took to walk in the door dissolves in disgust and a sense of victimization. Would a white member who indulged in such condescending malice face church discipline? Would the black newcomers be invited to white homes and treated as peers? And if there are economic disparities as well, would there be any reflection on the fact that some white/black economic disparity is a function of years of discrimination that, morally speaking, ought to be vehemently opposed by concerned Christians?[9] Moreover, if the black couple visiting the white church has a teenage boy who asks a white girl out on a date, what will be the response? And if such white believers were brought into a room and asked what the fundamental theological issues should be that govern their reflection on such matters, would they with one voice instantly and vehemently insist, “Justice! Justice!”? I don’t know what they would answer. I suspect that there would be such diversity of opinion that unanimity would be impossible. I imagine that very few would begin with the cross.

On the side of justice: Most discussions recognize the distinction between retributive justice and distributional justice—the justice that punishes the miscreant and the justice that tackles structural evils that control and manipulate the weak. Amos is certainly concerned with both. If Christians in power are concerned with issues of justice, they had better not sacrifice either pole. We may, of course, gropingly disagree, for example, on what the wisest and most effective changes in structure should be.

On the side of forgiveness: We have already seen that the most desirable forms of forgiveness are those that are tied to genuine reconciliation, but that Christians bear a responsibility and a privilege to forgive enemies even when the enemy is unwilling to be reconciled or remains unaware of the depth of the offense that he or she has caused. None of this forgiveness will be easy. But whatever our disagreements about the relationships between forgiveness that is carefully nurtured in one’s heart and mind and the practical outworkings of such forgiveness, the passion to forgive must characterize all who claim to serve a forgiving God.

The heart of the Christian message is that although human beings, made in the image of God, created by him and for him, have catapulted themselves into a squalid revolution with disastrous consequences, God himself has taken action to reconcile them to himself. When they become reconciled to God, they are set free in principle from sin—not in order to become completely autonomous, but to return to the God who made them and who owns them.

These two poles, creation and the fall, must be thought about together. There is more than a little danger that we will try to reverse the effects of racism by talking endlessly about human rights, about human dignity, about inherent human freedom. Great insight lies in all of these themes. If they are cut free from other biblical teaching, however, they tend to foster the lust for human autonomy that lies at the very heart of the fall.

Our dual citizenship means that we simultaneously reflect our own cultures and are called to be light and salt in these cultures. We belong; yet we do not belong. This means we must return to Scripture again and again in every generation to think through what elements of our culture are to be cherished, or at least not opposed, and what elements are evil and in need of reformation or overthrow. Truth to tell, very often the two are so intertwined that separation is not always easy. We must embrace both of our citizenships.

6-This change has drawn a great deal of comment. Popular sociology often refers to the first model, usually now with a good deal of disparagement, as the “melting-pot model”: all the ingredients lose their individual identities in the stew. The primary alternative often calls forth a “salad-bowl image”: each ingredient keeps its distinctive taste and yet contributes to the integrated flavor of the entire dish. Images aside, commentators increasingly recognize that the latter model can easily generate unseemly one-upmanship and foster discord and isolationism. Seeking a mediating pattern, some have tried to carve out a special domain of integration in the public sphere: see, for instance, Clarence Walhout, “Literature, Christianity, and the Public Sphere,” Christian Scholar’s Review 29 (1999), 361-373. Discussions are ongoing, but in my view public and private spheres are not so easily sealed off from each other.

But in this book I use the term to mean more than simply a basic level of self-consciousness. For me to be a self in the sense I am using the term here involves an understanding of what the purpose of my life is, of what constitutes the good life, of how I understand myself—my self—in relation to others and to the world around me. In this context—and as will become very clear in subsequent chapters—I am deeply indebted to the work of the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, particularly as found in his book Sources of the Self: The Making of the Modern Identity.2 In that work, Taylor highlights three points of significance in the modern development of what it means to be a self: a focus on inwardness, or the inner psychological life, as decisive for who we think we are; the affirmation of ordinary life that develops in the modern era; and the notion that nature provides us with an inner moral source.3 These developments manifest themselves in numerous ways. Most significant for my argument in this book, they lead to a prioritization of the individual’s inner psychology—we might even say “feelings” or “intuitions”—for our sense of who we are and what the purpose of our lives is. To leap ahead, transgenderism provides an excellent example: people who think they are a woman trapped in a man’s body are really making their inner psychological convictions absolutely decisive for who they are; and to the extent that, prior to “coming out,” they have publicly denied this inner reality, to that extent they have had an inauthentic existence. This is why the language of “living a lie” often appears in the testimonies of transgender people.

To return to my earlier statement, that the sexual revolution is a manifestation of a much deeper and wider revolution in what it means to be a self, my basic point should now be clear: the changes we have witnessed in the content and significance of sexual codes since the 1960s are symptomatic of deeper changes in how we think of the purpose of life, the meaning of happiness, and what actually constitutes people’s sense of who they are and what they are for. The sexual revolution did not cause the sexual revolution, nor did technology such as the pill or the internet.

The point I am making in asking the question is simple: the universal law of gravity explains why everything in general falls toward the earth, but it explains no specific incident of such a fall with any degree of adequacy. Those who hold to grand schemes of reality can all tend this way. The Christian might be tempted to declare that the reason for the sexual revolution was sin. People are sinful; therefore, they will inevitably reject God’s laws regarding sexuality.

My aim is to explain how and why a certain notion of the self has come to dominate the culture of the West, why this self finds its most obvious manifestation in the transformation of sexual mores, and what the wider implications of this transformation are and may well be in the future. Understanding the times is a precondition of responding appropriately to the times. And understanding the times requires a knowledge of the history that has led up to the present. This book is intended as a small contribution to that vital task.

THE PEASANT HAD A HANDFUL OF BEANS AND THE KING HAD SO MUCH HE WOULD NOT EVEN NOTICE THAT WHICH HE GAVE AWAY. IS THIS FAIR? “Yeah, but if you gave it all to the peasant then in a year or two he’d be just as snooty as the king—” began Albert, jaundiced observer of human nature. NAUGHTY AND NICE? said Death. BUT IT’S EASY TO BE NICE IF YOU’RE RICH. IS THIS FAIR? Albert wanted to argue. He wanted to say, Really? In that case, how come so many of the rich buggers is bastards?

concept deployed by Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor in his analysis of how societies think, that of the social imaginary. Taylor is interesting because he is a philosopher whose work also engages with broader historical and sociological themes. In A Secular Age, he offers a major analysis of the way modern society in general, and not just the intellectual classes, has moved away from being permeated by Christianity and religious faith to the point that such are no longer the default for the majority of people but actually are rather exceptional. In the course of his argument, he introduces the idea of the social imaginary to address the question of how theories developed by social elites might be related to the way ordinary people think and act, even when such people have never read these elites or spent any time self-consciously reflecting on the implications of their theories. Here is how he defines the concept: I want to speak of “social imaginary” here, rather than social theory, because there are important differences between the two. There are, in fact, several differences. I speak of “imaginary” (i) because I’m talking about the way ordinary people “imagine” their social surroundings, and this is often not expressed in theoretical terms, it is carried in images, stories, legends, etc. But it is also the case that (ii) theory is often the possession of a small minority, whereas what is interesting in the social imaginary is that it is shared by large groups of people, if not the whole society. Which leads to a third difference: (iii) the social imaginary is that common understanding which makes possible common practices, and a widely shared sense of legitimacy.2

In sum, the social imaginary is the way people think about the world, how they imagine it to be, how they act intuitively in relation to it—though that is emphatically not to make the social imaginary simply into a set of identifiable ideas.3 It is the totality of the way we look at our world, to make sense of it and to make sense of our behavior within it. This is a very helpful concept precisely because it takes account of the fact that the way we think about many things is not grounded in a self-conscious belief in a particular theory of the world to which we have committed ourselves. We live our lives in a more intuitive fashion than that. The fact that “I am a woman trapped in a man’s body” makes sense to Joe Smith probably has far less to do with him being committed to an elaborate understanding of the nature of gender and its relationship to biological sex than to the fact that it seems intuitively correct to affirm someone in his or her chosen identity and hurtful not to do so, however strange the particulars of that self-identification might have seemed to previous generations.

The notion of the self that makes transgenderism plausible certainly has its theoretical and philosophical rationales. But it is also the product of much wider cultural phenomena that have shaped the intuitions of those who are blissfully unaware of its various intellectual origins and metaphysical assumptions.

A second useful element in Taylor’s work that connects to the social imaginary and to which we will have recourse is the relationship between mimesis and poiesis. Put simply, these terms refer to two different ways of thinking about the world. A mimetic view regards the world as having a given order and a given meaning and thus sees human beings as required to discover that meaning and conform themselves to it. Poiesis, by way of contrast, sees the world as so much raw material out of which meaning and purpose can be created by the individual. Both of Taylor’s major works—Sources of the Self and A Secular Age—are narratives that tell the story of the move in Western culture from a predominantly mimetic view of the world to one that is primarily poietic. Various matters characterize this shift. As society moves from a view of the world as possessing intrinsic meaning, so it also moves away from a view of humanity as having a specific, given end.

The point I am making is that we all live in a world in which it is increasingly easy to imagine that reality is something we can manipulate according to our own wills and desires, and not something that we necessarily need to conform ourselves to or passively accept. And this broader context makes intuitive, for example, those philosophical claims of Friedrich Nietzsche, in which human beings are called to transcend themselves, to make their lives into works of art, to take the place of God as self-creators and the inventors, not the discoverers, of meaning. Few people have read Nietzsche, but many intuitively think in Nietzschean ways about their relationship to the natural world precisely because the highly technological world in which we now live—a world in which virtual reality is a reality—makes it so easy to do so. Self-creation is a routine part of our modern social imaginary.

Rieff’s approach to culture is characterized by a number of ideas. Foremost is his notion that cultures are primarily defined by what they forbid. This is a basically Freudian concept: if sexual taboos drive civilization, then civilization is really defined at its base by a negative idea, by that behavior that it denounces and renounces as unacceptable. This in turn has institutional implications: a culture’s vitality depends on the authority of those institutions that enforce or inculcate these renunciations and thus communicate them from one generation to the next.

Rieff: culture, at least historically, directs the individual outward. It is in communal activities that individuals find their true selves; the true self in traditional cultures is therefore something that is given and learned, not something that the individual creates for himself.

Rieff describes the outward direction of traditional culture as follows: “Culture is another name for a design of motives directing the self outward, toward those communal purposes in which alone the self can be realized and satisfied.”9 This is an important point: culture directs individuals outward. It is greater than, prior to, and formative of the individual. We learn who we are by learning how to conform ourselves to the purposes of the larger community to which we belong.

13. Roger Scruton notes the shift in the understanding of selfhood relative to forms of dance. Commenting on earlier forms of dancing, he observes that such typically assumed live music, formal steps that needed to be learned, and a meaning or pleasure derived from the individual being part of a coordinated whole, a social group. Such dancing was thus deeply social, and the ways in which the individual expressed his or her identity was communal. He contrasts this with modern nightclub-style dancing, in which the individual simply—to use the colloquial phrase—does his or her own thing. The former, he says, involves dancing with others, the latter at others (which, incidentally, has also involved a sexualizing of dancing’s purpose consonant with the sexualizing of society). “Dancing Properly,” in Confessions of a Heretic: Selected Essays (Widworthy, UK: Notting Hill Editions, 2016), 50–64. 14. See, for example,

Take, for example, the issue of job satisfaction, something that is significant for most adults. My grandfather left school at fifteen and spent the rest of his working life as a sheet metal worker in a factory in Birmingham, the industrial heartland of England. If he had been asked if he found satisfaction in his work, there is a distinct possibility he would not even have understood the question, given that it really reflects the concerns of psychological man’s world, to which he did not belong. But if he did understand, he would probably have answered in terms of whether his work gave him the money to put food on his family’s table and shoes on his children’s feet. If it did so, then yes, he would have affirmed that his job satisfied him. His needs were those of his family, and in enabling him to meet them, his work gave him satisfaction. My grandfather was, if anything, a Rieffian economic man whose economic production and the results of that for others (i.e., his family) were key to his sense of self. If I am asked the same question, my instinct is to talk about the pleasure that teaching gives me, about the sense of personal fulfillment I feel when a student learns a new idea or becomes excited about some concept as a result of my classes. The difference is stark: for my grandfather, job satisfaction was empirical, outwardly directed, and unrelated to his psychological state; for members of mine and subsequent generations, the issue of feeling is central.

Rieff sees two historic reversals underlying this new world of psychological man. The first is a transformation of the understanding of therapy. Traditionally, the role of the therapist in any given culture was to enable the patient to grasp the nature of the community to which he belonged. So in a religious world, the task of the religious therapist, the priest, was to train individuals in the rituals, the language, the doctrines, and the symbols of the church by which they might then participate in the community.

That, as I note in parts 2 and 3, is an idea that has come under vigorous criticism, beginning in the eighteenth century with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who regarded the community as a hindrance to the full expression of the authentic individual, a point picked up and given artistic expression by the Romantics.

In short, the basic thrust of much modern thinking serves to shatter the idea of the individual as one whose best interests are served by being educated to conform to the canons and protocols of society. And that is the intellectual foundation for the first reversal, whereby therapy ceases to serve the purpose of socializing an individual. Instead, it seeks to protect the individual from the kind of harmful neuroses that society itself creates through its smothering of the individual’s ability simply to be herself.

This then leads to the second reversal. In the worlds of political, religious, and economic man, commitment was outwardly directed to those communal beliefs, practices, and institutions that were bigger than the individual and in which the individual, to the degree that he or she conformed to or cooperated with them, found meaning. The ancient Athenian was committed to the assembly, the medieval Christian to his church, and the twentieth-century factory worker to his trade union and working man’s club. All of them found their purpose and well-being by being committed to something outside themselves. In the world of psychological man, however, the commitment is first and foremost to the self and is inwardly directed. Thus, the order is reversed. Outward institutions become in effect the servants of the individual and her sense of inner well-being.

This helps explain in part the concern in recent years over making the classroom a “safe place”—that is, a place where students go not to be exposed to ideas that may challenge their deepest beliefs and commitments (part of what was traditionally considered to be the role of education) but to be affirmed and reassured. While hostile commentators berate this tendency as that caused by the hypersensitivity of a generation of “snowflakes,” it is actually the result of the slow but steady psychologizing of the self and the triumph of inward-directed therapeutic categories over traditional outward-directed educational philosophies. That which hinders my outward expression of my inner feelings—that which challenges or attempts to falsify my psychological beliefs about myself and thus to disturb my sense of inner well-being—is by definition harmful and to be rejected. And that means that traditional institutions must be transformed to conform to the psychological self, not vice versa.

If education is to allow the individual simply to be himself, unhindered by outward pressure to conform to any greater reality, then the individual is king. He can be whoever he wants to be. And rejecting the notion of any external authority or meaning to which education is to conform, the individual simply makes himself the creator of any meaning that there might be. So-called “external” or “objective” truths are then simply constructs designed by the powerful to intimidate and to harm the weak. Overthrowing them—and thus overthrowing the notion that there is a great reality to which we are all accountable, whether that of the polis, of some religion, or of the economy—becomes the central purpose of educational institutions. They are not to be places to form or to transform but rather places where students can perform.

Nothing short of full equality under the law and full recognition of the legitimacy of certain nontraditional sexual identities by wider society has emerged as the ambition of the LGBTQ+ movement.

I must not tailor my psychological needs to the nature of society, for that would create anxiety and make me inauthentic. The refusal to bake me a wedding cake, therefore, is not an act consistent with the therapeutic ideal; in fact, it is the opposite—an act causing me psychological harm. There is therefore an outward, social dimension to my psychological well-being that demands others acknowledge my inward, psychological identity. We all as individuals still inhabit the same social spaces, still interact with other individuals, and so these other individuals must be coerced to be part of our therapeutic world.

Even the neologism hate speech speaks to this. While earlier generations might have seen damage to body or property as the most serious categories of crime, a highly psychologized era will accord increasing importance to words as means of oppression. And this represents a serious challenge to one of the foundations of liberal democracy: freedom of speech. Once harm and oppression are regarded as being primarily psychological categories, freedom of speech then becomes part of the problem, not the solution, because words become potential weapons.

There is, for sure, a deep desire in the modern West for self-expression, to perform in public in a manner consistent with that which one feels or thinks one is on the inside. That is the essence of authenticity as I will note in the thought of Rousseau in chapter 3. It is also the idea of authenticity that dominates the contemporary cultural imagination. Yet the desire to belong to some larger whole, to find unity with others, is also characteristic of modern selfhood.

When applied to the question of identity, specifically the kind of identities that the sexual revolution has brought in its wake, one can conclude that those that are considered legitimate—summed up by the LGBTQ+ acronym—are legitimate because they are recognized by the wider moral structure, the Sittlichkeit, of our society. The intuitive moral structure of our modern social imaginary prioritizes victimhood, sees selfhood in psychological terms, regards traditional sexual codes as oppressive and life denying, and places a premium on the individual’s right to define his or her own existence. All these things play into legitimizing and strengthening those groups that can define themselves in such terms. They capture, one might say, the spirit of the age. This helps explain why these identities are recognized and others are not. Pedophiles, for example, are currently unpersuasive as a victimized class, given the fact that they appear more as victimizers, however iconoclastic they are with regard to traditional sexual codes. Gay men, however, as consenting adults, are not seen as victimizers and can call on a long history of social marginalization and victimhood. They can thus claim a right to recognition, a recognition that is connected to a further aspect of the modern moral imagination, that of dignity.

This observation is important in enabling us to understand why, for example, in a society where sexuality is foundational to personal identity, mere tolerance of homosexuality is bound to become unacceptable. The issue is not one of simply decriminalizing behavior; that would certainly mean that homosexual acts were tolerated by society, but the acts are only a part of the overall problem. The real issue is one of recognition, of recognizing the legitimacy of who the person thinks he actually is. That requires more than mere tolerance; it requires equality before the law and recognition by the law and in society. And that means that those who refuse to grant such recognition will be the ones who find themselves on the wrong side of both the law and emerging social attitudes. The person who objects to homosexual practice is, in contemporary society, actually objecting to homosexual identity.

First and second worlds thus have a moral, and therefore cultural, stability because their foundations lie in something beyond themselves. To put it another way, they do not have to justify themselves on the basis of themselves. Third worlds, by way of stark contrast to the first and second worlds, do not root their cultures, their social orders, their moral imperatives in anything sacred. They do have to justify themselves, but they cannot do so on the basis of something sacred or transcendent. Instead, they have to do so on the basis of themselves.

Perhaps one of the most obvious is the way the cultural elites in third worlds are committed to cultural iconoclasm and to the overthrow of the beliefs, values, and behaviors of the past—that attitude C. S. Lewis called “chronological snobbery” raised to the level of a basic cultural instinct. Whereas in the first and second worlds, intellectuals and institutions such as universities were the conduits for the transmission and preservation of culture, now the intellectual class is devoted to the opposite—to the subversion, destabilization, and destruction of the culture’s traditions.

Marx and Engels noted in The Communist Manifesto that the capitalism of the Industrial Revolution depended on the constant re-creation of markets, and today we witness the continuation of that in, say, the strategies of a company such as Apple, with their clever production of new iPhone models and their nurturing of dissatisfaction with the old and desire for the new on which their marketing depends. Fashion, too, plays a similar role to technology: the creation of aesthetic trends in clothing, for example, is also designed to create future markets.

To understand exactly what Rieff is saying here, it is important to remember his basic agreement with Freud on the nature of culture/civilization: culture is constituted by those things that it forbids; the frustration that such rules create finds an outlet in art; thus, works of art are also constitutive of the culture, reflecting in some way the interdicts that are in place. A deathwork, by contrast, represents an attack on established cultural art forms in a manner designed to undo the deeper moral structure of society. We might add that deathworks are powerful because they are an important factor in changing the ethos of society, of altering that social imaginary with which, and according to which, we live our lives. Deathworks make the old values look ridiculous. They represent not so much arguments against the old order as subversions of it. They aim at changing the aesthetic tastes and sympathies of society so as to undermine the commands on which that society was based.

One of the key examples Rieff gives is that of Andres Serrano’s infamous work Piss Christ, in which a crucifix is shown submerged in the artist’s urine. In many ways, this is a quintessential example of that to which Rieff is pointing: a symbol of something deeply sacred to the second world being presented in a form that degrades it and makes it utterly repulsive. Serrano is not simply mocking the sacred order in this work of art; he has turned it into something dirty, disgusting, and vile. The highest authority of the second world, God, is literally cast into the sewer, the lowest of the low. The sacramental is made into the excremental.

Yet Rieff also notes that deathworks are not all as obvious in their assault on authority as Piss Christ, nor can they be restricted exclusively to the category of works of art. A deathwork can be anything that sets itself in opposition to the second-world culture.40 We might take cynicism and irony, for example. These have a tendency to subvert the kind of traditional, vertical structures of authority that characterize second worlds. Rieff himself cites James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake as an example of a work of art that does just this through its subversive use of language to mock those things that Christians hold dear. It may not be the aesthetically repellent approach of Serrano and his Piss Christ, but it is nonetheless corrosive of the sacred order.41 Satire could also be considered a deathwork. The subtle mockery of established authority that characterizes a satirical TV show or a humorous column in a newspaper could be categorized as a deathwork, slowly but surely undermining the established order of things.

A good working definition is provided by the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 2354: Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials.

In short, the major problem with pornography is not what many religious conservatives might understand it to be—its promotion of lust and its objectifying of the participants. It certainly does both of those things, but the problem is also much deeper: it repudiates any notion that sex has significance beyond the act itself, and therefore it rejects any notion that it is emblematic of a sacred order.

Underlying the notion of the deathwork is, as we noted, a basic repudiation of history as a source of authority and wisdom. This in turn means that what Rieff calls “forgetfulness” is one of the hallmarks of third worlds and a dominant trait of modern education. It is not simply that society just happens to be antihistorical in the way it approaches history. It has a vested interest in the actual erasure of history, of those things that conjure up unpleasant ideas that might disrupt happiness in the present.

Gerrand and Steven’s (2019: 45) study found that “orientation conducted in a group setting builds support” which was similarly found among the current study’s participants. Even though the parents in Gerrand and Steven’s (2019: 45) study were black South African prospective adoptive parents, whereas the current study had no black participants, the findings show that group orientation does provide support no matter the race of the participant. They added that parents felt the group orientation was a helpful bonding experience, one that provided comfort and reassurance and which helped “reduce feelings of isolation and self-doubt and offers encouragement, affirmation and hope” (Gerrand and Stevens 2019: 45). Additionally, Bergsund et al. (2018: 286-287) concluded that “[by] attending a preadoption course, participants may form lasting relationships with peers that can be highly useful during the challenging period of post-adoption.”

Overall, participants felt a need for support in their parenting, specifically related to adoption issues that could arise. This need for support from people who have been on a similar journey is commonly found in the adoption research literature (Shelton 2018: 117).

There was only at best a very vague concept of the will in classical philosophy; it is only when Paul offers his psychological account of the Christian’s inner struggle in his first-century New Testament letters, which was then picked up and developed in a deeply personal and elaborate way by Augustine in his Confessions at the end of the fourth century, that we find the basic tools for conceptualizing humans as primarily psychological beings.

Thus, the purpose of autobiography, the delineation of the story of one particular self by that self, is to be psychological in its orientation, for that is where the real person is to be found. Obviously, lives are marked by the interaction of the individual with the world around—people, places, and so on. But the real drama, that which takes one to the heart of what constitutes the essence of a person, is the inner psychological life that is shaped by these outward circumstances and contingencies.

The first occurs in book 1, where a local man, M. Verrat, persuades the young Rousseau to steal some of Verrat’s mother’s asparagus for him so that he might sell it and make some money. Rousseau’s account of his act of theft allows him to reflect in some detail on the psychology of what he was doing, and two things stand out in his analysis. First, he emphasizes that the motivation for the crime was not greed but “only to oblige the person who was making me do it.”8 Thus, the act was driven not by some inward impulse that was intrinsically sinful but by a good desire that led him to perform a sinful act. He stole the asparagus to help Verrat. The desire was a basically good one; it was only the manner in which he fulfilled it that was morally problematic. This is important for understanding Rousseau’s view of the nature of human corruption as something that is created and fostered by social conditions and not something to be considered innate. This is obvious in a second aspect of the narrative, which underlines that the crime is the result of social pressure, not some internal tendency to depravity—in this case, the cajoling by M. Verrat. It does not arise spontaneously within Rousseau himself but derives from his relationship with Verrat. Indeed, in the context of the Confessions as a whole, this story comes immediately after Rousseau’s acquisition of numerous vices that were each the result of the social conditions in which he found himself: his master treated him badly, hence he started lying and became lazy; his father punished him rather too harshly, and this made him both manipulative and covetous. Society, or at least the society in which he found himself, is to blame for the young Rousseau’s delinquency. His corruption is essentially the result of his reaction to corrupting circumstances.

We might therefore summarize the basic difference between the two men as follows: Augustine blames himself for his sin because he is basically wicked from birth; Rousseau blames society for his sin because he is basically good at birth and then perverted by external forces. What the account of the asparagus does is point to the fact that, for Rousseau, the social order is a source of falsehood or, to use the modern term, inauthenticity. Men and women are born good and corrupted by the society that surrounds them. As Charles Taylor expresses Rousseau’s thinking, “The original impulse of nature is right, but the effect of a depraved culture is that we lose contact with it.”

Rousseau sees a real danger of exactly the opposite: it will in reality foster hypocrisy and wickedness because it creates a society where the need to belong and to conform requires individuals to be false to who they really are. Society creates the rules by which the individual must play in order to be accepted, and those rules are contrary to the simple economy of easily met innate desires created by basic physical needs found in the state of nature. This claim is of great significance for understanding many of the pathologies of our current cultural moment. We might say that Rousseau is arguing, at a basic level, that it is society and the relations and conditions that society embodies that decisively shape and, in the description above, decisively corrupt individuals. That is a point so basic to much of modern liberal thought that it verges on the platitudinous.

Authentic self-expression of the kind available to the hypothetical savage, unencumbered by the expectations of culture, is therefore impossible to the one born in a civilized society because that society will not allow such behavior and is likely, in fact, to punish it. The authentic human being is regarded with contempt by cultivated society, perhaps even as a criminal. To be a member of such society, one must therefore suppress these personal, natural desires and instincts and conform to socially normative canons of behavior. And in the process, one becomes inauthentic, untrue to one’s inner (real) self. To use the modern phrase, one ends up living a lie.

Pity as a foundation for ethics therefore points toward two important elements of Rousseau’s thought. The first is the social dimension of human beings even in their hypothetical natural state, for pity is always directed toward another. It cannot exist in perfect isolation as a solipsistic virtue. As noted above, self-love is not a matter of untrammeled self-interest at the expense of all others, nor is it exemplified in a kind of splendid isolation. The key to appropriate self-love is that the individual’s desires are connected to basic needs and do not exceed them: enough food to eat, a mate for companionship and procreation, and sufficient rest to keep the body healthy.

The second important element of Rousseau’s thought that emerges in the discussion of pity and the foundation of ethics in sentiment is that he sees aesthetics as key to morality. The virtuous person is the one whose instincts, whose sentimental or emotional responses to particular situations, are correctly attuned. No law can make men or women moral if their sentiments are not properly ordered. This is an extremely significant notion. It has obvious implications for education: if human beings in the state of nature have naturally correct sentiments, then the purpose of education in the real, actual world in which we live becomes not what it was traditionally conceived as being: the training of individuals in the intellectual, social, and moral competencies necessary for being a member of society. On the contrary, education is about allowing the person to mature in a manner that protects her from precisely those cultural influences that traditional schooling is designed to cultivate and that merely inflame amour propre. These serve only to alienate her from who she really is, making her inauthentic.
